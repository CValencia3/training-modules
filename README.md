# UXSoc Training Modules

1. Install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
1. Run `npm i`
1. Open *index.html*  preferably in Webstorm and then run `npm start`. The homepage will automatically open.

You can now access various modules and the're html will appear in index.html!

After editing the *index.html* file the webpage opened will automatically reload.

## Backing up to GitHub
First make sure this project was forked and not just cloned, in order to take advantage of backup features. Next:

1. Run the command `npm run backup`
2. Git commit either in your IDE or with `git commit -m "message"`
3. `git push`

## Tips 
- The index.html file will save automatically for each module so you can always go back!
- Whenever the webpage updates, the UI bar will be a different color and the emoji will change.
- Additional html is injected to load the UI in the webpage, but don't worry it shouldn't affect your html.
- Try to avoid having more than one webpage of this open at a time.
- Have fun!
